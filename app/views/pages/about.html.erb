<p>Hey, welcome to my very own web page!</p>
<p>I built this during the program Code to Success with the help of Jordan Hudgens.  I am pretty new to coding, but I really like it so far.  Anyways, my name is Mackenzie, as you most likely already know, I am 17 but turn 18 on August 26.  I am an only child.  I have a pet lizard named 
Johnny and a snake named Kit.  They're both very cute.</p>
